### ## üì° Phase 1: Initial Discovery & Host Discovery

**Goal:** Identify all web-facing assets, including subdomains and virtual hosts that might not be publicly linked.

* **Subdomain Enumeration:**
    * Find all subdomains associated with the main domain to discover hidden applications, APIs, or development environments.
        ```bash
        # Use subfinder to passively query public sources
        subfinder -d example.com -silent

        # Use ffuf to actively brute-force common subdomain names
        ffuf -w /path/to/subdomains.txt -u [http://FUZZ.example.com](http://FUZZ.example.com)
        ```

* **Virtual Host Discovery (VHost Fuzzing):**
    * Find websites that are hosted on the same IP address but respond to different `Host` headers. This can uncover hidden sites.
        ```bash
        # Use ffuf to fuzz the Host header on a specific IP
        ffuf -w /path/to/subdomains.txt -u http://<TARGET_IP> -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com"
        ```

### ## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 2: Network-Level Probing (Nmap)

**Goal:** Scan the web server to identify all open ports, not just 80/443. This can reveal administration interfaces, staging servers, or other services.

* **Comprehensive Nmap Scan:**
    * Run a detailed scan to find all open TCP ports, identify the services and their versions, and run safe enumeration scripts.
        ```bash
        # -p- : Scan all 65,535 TCP ports
        # -sV : Determine service/version info
        # -sC : Run default, safe scripts (e.g., http-title)
        # -T4 : Aggressive timing for a faster scan
        nmap -p- -sV -sC -T4 <TARGET_IP> -oA nmap_scan
        ```
    * **What to look for:** Web servers on non-standard ports (e.g., 8000, 8080, 8443), SSH (22), FTP (21), or database ports (3306).

### ## üîé Phase 3: Web Server & Technology Fingerprinting

**Goal:** Understand the technology stack (server, language, framework, CMS) to tailor further attacks.

* **Identify Technologies:**
    * Use **`whatweb`** for a detailed breakdown of the technologies used.
        ```bash
        whatweb [http://example.com](http://example.com)
        # Looks for things like Apache, PHP, WordPress, jQuery, etc.
        ```
    * Use a browser extension like **Wappalyzer** for quick, real-time analysis as you browse the site.

* **Inspect HTTP Headers:**
    * Manually check the server's response headers for revealing information.
        ```bash
        # -I sends a HEAD request to fetch only the headers
        curl [http://example.com](http://example.com) -I
        ```
    * **What to look for:** `Server` (e.g., `Apache/2.4.41`), `X-Powered-By` (e.g., `PHP/7.4.3`), and any non-standard or custom headers.

### ## üìÇ Phase 4: Content Discovery (Directory & File Fuzzing)

**Goal:** Find hidden or unlinked directories, files, pages, and API endpoints. This is often the most fruitful part of web enumeration.

* **Directory & File Brute-Forcing:**
    * Use **`ffuf`** with a good wordlist to discover content.
        ```bash
        # -w : Wordlist path
        # -u : URL with FUZZ as the placeholder
        # -fc : Filter status codes (e.g., hide 404s)
        ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u [http://example.com/FUZZ](http://example.com/FUZZ) -fc 404
        ```

* **Recursive Fuzzing:**
    * After finding a directory (e.g., `/admin`), run another fuzzing scan inside it.
        ```bash
        ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u [http://example.com/admin/FUZZ](http://example.com/admin/FUZZ) -fc 404
        ```

* **File Extension Fuzzing:**
    * Look for files with specific extensions, especially backups or old versions.
        ```bash
        # -e : Adds extensions to each word in the wordlist
        ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u [http://example.com/FUZZ](http://example.com/FUZZ) -e .php,.bak,.old,.txt,.zip
        ```

---

### ## üéØ Phase 5: Automated Vulnerability Scanning

**Goal:** Run a quick, automated scan for common low-hanging fruit, misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities.

* **Nikto Scan:**
    * **`nikto`** is a classic web server scanner that checks for thousands of potentially dangerous files and misconfigurations.
        ```bash
        nikto -h [http://example.com](http://example.com)
        ```
    * **What to look for:** Outdated server versions, default installation files, dangerous HTTP methods (e.g., `PUT`), and other common security issues.

### ### What to Look Out For: A Summary

During enumeration, your primary goal is to find an entry point. Keep an eye out for:

* **Login Portals:** Pages like `/admin`, `/login.php`, `/portal`.
* **Exposed Configuration Files:** `wp-config.php.bak`, `.env`, `web.config`, `settings.py`.
* **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Publicly accessible `.git` directories, `.DS_Store` files, log files (`.log`), or backup archives (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`).
* **API Endpoints:** Directories like `/api`, `/v1`, `/v2` that might have different authentication or vulnerabilities.
* **Informative Error Messages:** Pages that leak framework versions, database errors, or local file paths.
* **Outdated Software:** Any component (CMS, framework, server) with a known public exploit (CVE).
